\chapter{Introduction}

Data visualization allow us to take valuable information from itself instead of being bored from reading rows upon rows of spreadsheet data. It also allows extracting complex data into graphic visual representations and to communicate information clearly and efficiently via interactive graphical presentations. This visual communication process becomes for efficient when interactivity is added to it. Since July 2014, the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) has been providing interactive charts on electricity production and other related information regarding electricity and power generation in Germany. This charts became very popular and widely used by people from different profession namely scientists, politicians, journalists as well as online/printed media. Due to the high popularity of these interactive energy charts, an additional interactive map is developed to make the whole framework more informative and interesting for the users. Thereby the aim of this visualization tool was to develop an interactive map to illustrate the geographical location of power plants in Germany on the OpenStreetMap. On top of that, this data layer is providing necessary information about power plants, source, capacity, operator, start date and other additional information that user might interested in. Furthermore, this new visualization framework is interconnected with the existing energy charts which make the framework stronger in principle.

However, the data set used for this visualization does not include all renewable and non-renewable power plants. Basically, the data is periodically collected from European Energy Exchange(EEX) in Leipzig, which include power plants that are larger than 100MW. Their reporting is obligatory to EEX. In addition, the data also contains information on voluntary reporting companies which are generating a relatively low power output. Apart from this, this interactive map also illustrates the power lines of Germany, specifically the 110KV, 220KV and 380KV lines. The data set for these power lines is extracted using Overpass turbo API. 

Due to the lack of frameworks that supply a sufficient visualization for this kind of scenario and data, it seemed to be essential to develop some additional interacting factors can be added to present the data in a way which tells the story of the data set more clearly. On the other hand, there is a scope of giving the user more control to make the interactive chart more useful. The main focus of this project was to visualize the data overlaid on a geographical projection using open source data mapping tool and deploy this framework to the web environment. In addition, a fully interactive data visualization is provided by adding custom API which allows technical and non-technical experts easy to get to grips with and custom made glyph icons are used to grasp the context.
